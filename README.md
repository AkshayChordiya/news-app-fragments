[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/AkshayChordiya//blob/master/LICENSE)

A simple News Android application written in **Kotlin** (YAY!) for demo at Fragments conference


## What's the app about?
It's an extremely simple app which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to show the latest news from Google News.
It uses [Retrofit 2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) library to fetch the news from the NewsAPI and show them on the UI.

## Goal of this app
The main goal of this sample app is show how to build robust and less crashable Android apps with Kotlin . It also shows the concise nature of Kotlin language and it's interoperability with Java.
All this while having fun with Android.

## Steps to run:
- Go to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!)
- Put the API key at the bottom of the `gradle.properties`
`
NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
`
- Run the app
- Enjoyyyyy ðŸŽ‰
